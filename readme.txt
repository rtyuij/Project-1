I'm pretty happy with this as a first project, but it's still a ways off from being finished, here is a list of updates that I would like to do:

1. Add a modal window that pops up when someone clicks the "Updates" link with a newsletter signup form. I tried to do this through formspree but didn't 
have enough time to figure it out.

2. I have already associated each key with a color, and the eventual idea is that when the user gets a question right, a short animation is played featuring an original superhero associated with that key doing some kind of badass move, wearing an outfit that also matches the associated color of the key.

3. With a wrong answer, I would eventually like to momentarily overlay the game page with a fixed image of Dana Carvey as John McLaughlin (inside of one of those big red circles with the line going through it) and play a sound file of him saying "WRONG!!!" It's a funny bit from Saturday Night Live and I thought it would add some humor to the game.
