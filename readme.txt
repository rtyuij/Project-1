I'm pretty happy with this as a first project, but I still have a few updates in mind, here is what I can think of now:

1. I have already associated each key with a color, and the eventual idea is that when the user gets a question right, a short animation is played featuring an original superhero associated with that key doing some kind of badass move, wearing an outfit that also matches the associated color of the key.

2. With a wrong answer, I would eventually like to momentarily overlay the game page with a fixed image of Dana Carvey as John McLaughlin (inside of one of those big red circles with the line going through it) and play a sound file of him saying "WRONG!!!" It's a funny bit from Saturday Night Live and I thought it would add some humor to the game.

3. I get the feeling my CSS code is highly flawed (a tutor told me basing everything on view height or view width is not a good idea), so at some point I may have to go back and make sure everything looks better with varying window/screen sizes. I guess I am a beginner though, so of course it's not going to be perfect (as much as I can't stand that). I put a lot of time into this, it's a good effort for a first project, at least.
